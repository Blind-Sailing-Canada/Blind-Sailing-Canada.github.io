BSAC Purchase Terms and Conditions

Book early! Seating on our boats is limited and all reservations are first come first served.

All sales are final. 

We accept all major credit cards. E-transfers can be also made to finance@blindsailing.ca using your online banking.
If paying by e-transfer, please add a note indicating your name and the items you wish to purchase.

Sail purchases do not guarantee choice of sail time or boat. Please ensure there is space at your preferred date and time before making your purchase.

After booking a sail time, we ask that cancellations be made no later than 24 hours in advance.
If you cancel with at least 24 hours notice, we will apply your sail fee to another sail at a later date of your choosing.
If you cancel with less than 24 hours notice or do not show up, your sail fee will be forfeited. There are no refunds.

The safety of our members and volunteers is of paramount importance and as such, any sail may be canceled at any time due to weather, mechanical or any other issue as determined by the skipper in his/her sole discretion.
If your sail is canceled under these circumstances, we will apply your sail fee to another sail at a later date of your choosing.

Unused sail purchases do not expire. Sails purchased in one season may be applied to bookings in a following season.
This also applies to individual sails purchased as part of multi-sail packages with the exception of the Unlimited Sailing Package.

Unlimited Sailing Packages are valid only for the season in which they are purchased, regardless of the number of bookings made and/or sails realized.

You must be a paid member of BSAC in order to purchase and book a sail with us.
Guest sails may only be purchased by members. Guests must be accompanied by a paying member on all sails.

Service dogs are welcome on our boats. Space is limited. Please let us know in advance if you will be accompanied by your dog.

Sorry, there is no smoking on the docks or on our boats at any time.
Please do not ask fellow sailors for permission to smoke. 
Lifejackets will be supplied and are mandatory while underway.
Masks are optional while on our boats but may be required at Marina Quay West facilities. 
All members, guests and volunteers must abide by the rules and policies of Marina Quay West and Harbourfront Centre at all times.
